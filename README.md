# Description of the task

# Title : Real-Time Threat Mitigation in MCPS using RNN, Isolation Forest & Optimization

Overview
CyberFedDefender is a real-time adaptive cybersecurity framework built for Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). It uses machine learning and optimization to detect, assess, and mitigate cyber threats under strict budget and resource constraints.

This system combines:

  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequence-based anomaly detection,

  Isolation Forest for unsupervised threat detection,

  Business optimization model (Linear Programming) for strategic, cost-efficient mitigation.
