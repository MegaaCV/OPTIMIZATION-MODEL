# Title : Real-Time Threat Mitigation in MCPS using RNN, Isolation Forest & Optimization

**Overview**


CyberFedDefender is a real-time adaptive cybersecurity framework built for Mobile Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS). It uses machine learning and optimization to detect, assess, and mitigate cyber threats under strict budget and resource constraints.

This system combines:

  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequence-based anomaly detection,

  Isolation Forest for unsupervised threat detection,

  Business optimization model (Linear Programming) for strategic, cost-efficient mitigation.


  **Features**

  
 Real-time threat detection using ML models

 Resource-aware threat mitigation using optimization

 Interactive analytics dashboard with Plotly

 Cost efficiency analysis of mitigation strategies

 Visualizations: Scatter, Bar, Heatmap, Box, and Pie charts
 

  | Purpose           | Algorithm                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Anomaly Detection | Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)                   |
| Outlier Detection | Isolation Forest                                  |
| Optimization      | Linear Programming (via `scipy.optimize.linprog`) |
| Visualization     | Plotly (Interactive graphs)                       |

 **How It Works**
 
1. Load & preprocess the dataset.

2. Detect anomalies using RNN and Isolation Forest.

3. Label threats based on detection confidence.

4. Optimize threat mitigation under budget & resource constraints.

5. Visualize the results using Plotly interactive dashboards

**Future Enhancements**


1. Integrate Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive policy learning.

2. Real-time streaming data integration from IoT sensors.

3. Web-based dashboard deployment using Streamlit or Dash.

4. Extension to smart cities, hospitals, and autonomous networks.
